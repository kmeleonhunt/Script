# Script
Where I share my newbie work.

Every script comes with a synospis and comments.

It is useless to direclty run the scrypt as those are usually templates unless there is "GUI" in the title.

About me ?

I'm just a beginner powershell user, and you'll surely find some part from other github member in my scripts.

Unfortunately for the first ones I cannot source them...

So please if you recognize someone else work, DO tell me the source so I can thanks them for the knowledge they provided me with.


Hope you'll find my script usefull at some point and maybe share with me how you've changed them for other results :)
